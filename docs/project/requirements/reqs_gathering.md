# Requirements gathering


## **Requirement Gathering Techniques**

- **Interviews**: Conduct structured conversations with stakeholders.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Distribute these to gather broad input.
- **User Stories**: Create user stories to capture specific functionalities from the user’s perspective.
- **Observation**: Understand user interaction with existing systems, if applicable.

For the requirements gathering phase of your DevOps project, focusing on architectural and technical user stories, and systems observation, here's a detailed outline:


### **Architectural and Technical User Stories**

- **User Story Creation**: 
  - Develop user stories that capture the functional and technical requirements of the system from an architectural perspective.
  - Each story should clearly state the 'who', 'what', and 'why' to articulate the needs of different system components or stakeholders (even hypothetical ones).
- **Example User Stories**:
  - As a system administrator, I want to automate server creation using scripts so that the infrastructure setup is efficient and repeatable.
  - As a developer, I need a continuous deployment process that automatically deploys the latest code changes to a test environment, ensuring rapid feedback and iteration.
  - As an application user, I expect the system to scale automatically based on demand to maintain optimal performance during peak usage.


### **Technical Requirements from User Stories**

- **Requirement Extraction**:
  - Extract and list the technical requirements from each user story.
  - Categorize these requirements based on their nature, such as infrastructure, security, deployment, monitoring, etc.
- **Requirement Validation**:
  - Review the extracted requirements for clarity, feasibility, and relevance to the project's objectives.


### 3.3 **Systems Observation**

- **Existing Systems Analysis**:
  - If applicable, analyze existing systems or similar projects to extract insights and requirements.
  - Document how current systems are architected, their limitations, and potential areas of improvement.
- **Market and Technology Research**:
  - Conduct research on current market trends and emerging technologies in cloud infrastructure, containerization, and DevOps practices.
  - Identify best practices and standards that can be incorporated into the project.
- **Benchmarking**:
  - Compare with similar projects or case studies to benchmark expected functionalities and performance standards.


### 3.4 **Requirement Prioritization**

- **MoSCoW Method**:
  - Utilize the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have) to prioritize requirements based on their importance and impact on the project goals.
- **Dependency Analysis**:
  - Analyze dependencies between requirements to understand their sequence of implementation.


### 3.5 **Documentation of Requirements**

- **Requirement Documentation**:
  - Create a comprehensive document listing all gathered requirements, including user stories and findings from system observation.
- **Requirement Traceability**:
  - Establish a traceability matrix to link requirements to specific project objectives, ensuring all goals are addressed.


### 3.6 **Review and Feedback**

- **Internal Review**:
  - Conduct internal reviews with the project team to ensure all technical requirements are realistic and aligned with project objectives.
- **Feedback Incorporation**:
  - Make adjustments to the requirements based on feedback from these reviews.
