# Project functional requirements

Implementing a Traefik/FastAPI/PostgreSQL application in a DevOps project requires a detailed outline for the functional requirements study and elicitation. Here's a structured approach to guide you through this process:

[Project overview](overview.md)

[Stakeholders](stakeholders.md)

[Requirements gathering](reqs_gathering.md)

[Requirements analysis](reqs_analysis.md)

[Specific Requirements for Key Components](reqs_key_componenents.md)




## 6. **Use Cases and User Scenarios**

- Develop detailed use cases for each major functionality.
- Outline user scenarios to understand the application flow.

## 7. **Validation and Verification**

- Review requirements with stakeholders for validation.
- Plan for requirement changes and incorporate a change management process.

## 8. **Documentation**

- Create a detailed requirements document.
- Ensure clarity, completeness, and testability of requirements.

## 9. **Security and Compliance Considerations**

- Identify security requirements, especially for data handling and storage.
- Address compliance with relevant standards or regulations.

## 10. **Tools and Techniques for Management**

- Utilize tools like JIRA or Trello for tracking requirements.
