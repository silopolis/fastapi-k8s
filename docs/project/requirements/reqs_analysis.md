# Requirement Analysis

- **Categorization**: Classify requirements into functional (directly related to the application’s functionality) and non-functional (like performance, security).
- **Prioritization**: Use techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have this time) to prioritize requirements.
- **Feasibility Study**: Ensure the technical and financial viability of the requirements.

In Part 4, focusing on the analysis of the requirements gathered for your DevOps project, a detailed approach is necessary to ensure that the requirements are feasible, relevant, and aligned with the project's goals. Here's a structured outline for the requirements analysis phase:

## 4.1 **Categorization of Requirements**

- **Functional vs. Non-Functional**:
 - Separate the requirements into functional (directly related to the application’s functionality) and non-functional (related to system performance, security, etc.).
- **Technical Categorization**:
 - Further categorize the requirements based on technical aspects such as infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, security, etc.

## 4.2 **Feasibility Study**

- **Technical Feasibility**:
 - Assess whether the technical requirements are achievable with the current technology stack and resources.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
 - Analyze the costs involved versus the benefits each requirement brings to the project.
- **Risk Assessment**:
 - Identify potential risks associated with each requirement and propose mitigation strategies.


## 4.3 **Requirement Prioritization**

- **Revisit Prioritization**:
 - Reassess the prioritization of requirements based on the feasibility study and risk assessment.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**:
 - Ensure the prioritized requirements align with the project objectives and hypothetical stakeholder needs.


## 4.4 **Dependency Analysis**

- **Interdependency Identification**:
 - Identify dependencies between various requirements.
- **Impact Analysis**:
 - Analyze the impact of these dependencies on the project timeline and resource allocation.


## 4.5 **Gap Analysis**

- **Current vs. Desired State**:
 - Compare the current capabilities (if any existing systems are in place) with the desired state as defined by the requirements.
- **Identify Gaps**:
 - Highlight any gaps that exist and need to be addressed to meet the project objectives.


## 4.6 **Integration and Compatibility Analysis**

- **System Integration**:
 - Assess how the new requirements will integrate with existing systems or technologies (if applicable).
- **Compatibility Check**:
 - Ensure that the requirements are compatible with the overall system architecture, including cloud infrastructure and deployment platforms.


## 4.7 **Review and Adjustment**

- **Internal Review**:
 - Conduct thorough reviews with the project team to discuss and refine the analysis.
- **Requirement Refinement**:
 - Make necessary adjustments to the requirements based on the outcome of the analysis and reviews.


## 4.8 **Documentation and Approval**

- **Updated Requirement Documentation**:
 - Update the requirements document to reflect all analyses, adjustments, and final decisions.
- **Approval Process**:
 - Establish a process for the formal approval of the analyzed requirements, ensuring they are locked in for the next phases of the project.
